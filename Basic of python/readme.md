# Experiment 2: Fundamentals of Python Programming

## 🌟 Overview
This repository contains my study on the foundational commands of Python. The experiment covers variable definition, user input handling, arithmetic operations, and a practical implementation of these concepts through a simple calculator project.

## 🎯 Aim
To explore and master the basic instructions, syntax, and operations of the Python programming language.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Jupyter Notebook** (Local Environment)
* **Google Colab** (Cloud-based IDE)

## 📚 Theory & Key Concepts

### 1. Introduction to Python
Introduced in 1991, Python was inspired by languages like C and SETL. Its popularity stems from its focus on **readability** and **development speed**, allowing developers to build complex systems much faster than low-level languages.

### 2. Modules & Libraries
Python’s power lies in its ability to import specialized modules. During this study, I explored:
* `math`: For advanced mathematical functions.
* `random`: For generating random numbers.
* `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.



### 3. Data Types & Mutability
Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning the interpreter automatically detects the data type at runtime. 
* **Mutable Types:** Can be changed after creation (e.g., Lists, Dictionaries).
* **Immutable Types:** Cannot be modified once defined (e.g., Strings, Tuples).
* **Constants:** Variables intended to remain unchanged throughout the program.

### 4. User Interaction
* **Input:** Handled via the `input()` function. Since `input()` defaults to a string, **Type Casting** (e.g., `int()` or `float()`) is necessary for numerical operations.
* **Output:** Handled via the `print()` function to display results to the console.

## 🔢 Operators in Python
I experimented with five primary categories of operators:

1. **Arithmetic:** Basic math (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
2. **Assignment:** Giving values to variables (`=`, `+=`, `-=`).
3. **Comparison:** Evaluating relationships between values (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`).
4. **Logical:** Combining conditional statements (`and`, `or`, `not`).
5. **Bitwise:** Performing operations at the binary level (similar to C).

## 💡 Applications & Advantages
Python's flexibility makes it a staple for:
* **Industry Giants:** Netflix and Spotify use it for recommendation algorithms.
* **Space Exploration:** NASA and ISRO utilize it for data analysis.
* **Logistics:** Real-time calculation and route optimization.

**Why I prefer Python:**
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Go from idea to code in minutes.
* **Dynamic Typing:** Offers great flexibility during development.
* **Memory Management:** Automated garbage collection handles memory for you.
